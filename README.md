|DCC-Main  |  561 bytes |
|DCC-With-Text  |  841 bytes|

## DCC Min
Made to be as small as possible, no explinations for anything, made to show how small I could get it

## DCC
Just the base script, nothing fancy, only explains things when it needs to.

## DCC With Text
Most user friendly. Explains what it's doing to the user at every stage to try and avoid scaring the user off. Especially when a paranoid user is seeing a script that they got off the internet downloading something without their consent. All variables in this script were given full there full names, this was done to make it easier to edit.

#### If you are confused on which to download just use **DCC-With-Text** is the best as it explains itself as it is doing said tasks.
> This was just a challenge, to try make somthing as small as possible
