# Discord-Cache-Cleaner
Simple Discord cache viewer and cleaner written in batch

There are 3 files chose which one (they all fundamentally do the same thing)
- DCC-Min  |  440 bytes
- DCC-Main  |  523 bytes 
- DCC-With-Text  |  989 bytes

## DCC Min
Made to be as small as possible, no explinations for anything, made to show how small I could get it

## DCC
Just the base script, nothing fancy, only explains things when it needs to.

## DCC With Text
Most user friendly. Explains what its doing to the user at every stage to try and avoid scaring the user off. Especially when someone who thinks everything is a virus and sees a script they got off the internet downloading something without their consent. All variables in this script are as they "normally" would be and are not made as short as possible, this was done to make it easier to edit.

#### If you are confused on which to download just download **DCC-With-Text** as it explains itself as it is doing said tasks.
